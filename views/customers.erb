					<p>“We previously were using a burn off oven and have been operating our new machine for over a year and a half.  We can do in one shift, what it used to take three to four shifts to complete as the cycles are under an hour.</p>
					<p>There is no ash to deal with so along with the reduced mess our other processes have even improved.  No post washing needed, our pretreatment solution lasts longer and the amount of rejects caused by coated or dirty hooks has almost disappeared.</p>
					<p>Since purchasing this machine, our employees have benefited not only from the cleanliness of the cleaning area, but the safety features built into this machine make it very operator friendly.</p>
					<p>There is no smoke to contend with in the factory, like the competitor’s model that we witnessed, due to the new front load unit.</p>
					<p>This was most definitely money well spent.”</p>
